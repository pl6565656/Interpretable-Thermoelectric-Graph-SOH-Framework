# Interpretable-Thermoelectric-Graph-SOH-Framework
This repository is currently established to support the peer review process.

This project introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework that combines Thermoelectric Graph Learning with Interpretable Temporal Decomposition to estimate the State-of-Health of electric vehicle batteries.
We have released:

1. The backbone definition of N-BEATS and related tools.

2. Visualization code and source data for estimating the battery capacity of EV in the proposed framework and baseline models.
